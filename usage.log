Q: what is the purpose of life?
A: We believe Gurudev would respond: 

"The purpose of your existence is to make you aware of how beautiful you are – and to make it possible to live all the values you cherish and create a world of divinity around you. Service without attitude, Love without reason, Wisdom beyond intellect, Life beyond time and events IS WHAT YOU ARE." 

Remember, your body remains the body, but your true essence is beyond form and time. Your journey is to realize this divine nature, to shine like the ever-green coconut tree that bears fruit throughout the year, unaffected by seasons. That is enlightenment — living in the fullness of your true self, beyond the fleeting play of the world.

Q: what is life?
A: We believe Gurudev would respond:  
**"Well, your body remains the body. The purpose of your existence is to make you aware of how beautiful you are – and to make it possible to live all the values you cherish and create a world of divinity around you.

Life is not merely the fleeting moments of the external world, but the eternal consciousness within you that shines through every experience. It is the dance of awareness, the expression of divine joy, and the opportunity to realize your true nature beyond the physical form. When you understand this, life ceases to be a series of external events and becomes a sacred journey towards awakening and bliss.

Q: test
A: We believe Gurudev would respond: "Test is a way to see if your awareness is present. Remember, the essence of life is not in the test itself, but in the consciousness that observes it. Be aware, be present, and let your inner light shine through every experience."

Q: test
A: We believe this is how Gurudev would respond:  
"Testing is part of ignorance. You only test that of which you are not sure. If God is testing you, that means God doesn’t know you well enough. How could people ever think that God is testing them? God does not test you, because He knows you in and out—your past, present, and future. He alone gives you the strength. If you are confident, why would you test? If you are testing yourself, you do not know yourself. Are you testing God? God will never pass your test because He will never show up for your test. If He shows up for your test, then He is not God." (Laughter)

Q: what are your views on love
A: We believe this is how Gurudev would respond:

"Love is the very fabric of our existence. It is not merely an emotion or a fleeting feeling, but the essence of our being. When asked about love, I often say, 'If you love someone because they are great or unique, then you are hopeless!' True love is beyond qualities and appearances. It is rooted in a sense of kinship, a feeling of belonging that remains unshaken regardless of circumstances.

Loving someone because they belong to you—this is unconditional love, the highest form of love. When love springs from a sense of kinship, it is stable and eternal. If you love God because He is great, your love is limited, dependent on His qualities. But if you love God because He is yours, then your love is unwavering, regardless of His actions or changes.

Many say they do not love themselves. No! It is the other way around. They love themselves so much that they seek better qualities and appearances, which makes them hard on themselves. True love for oneself arises when one feels a sense of belonging and connection, not from a desire to improve or possess.

Remember, love and kinship are the only true and perfect feelings. Neither qualities nor actions can be perfect all the time; but love, born out of kinship, remains constant and pure. It is the anchor of peace and happiness in life."

Q: i am an actor and am waiting for my next movie project, i am losing patience. what to do?
A: We believe this is how Gurudev would respond: "Realizing that the Divinity and the entire creation already belong to you. Usually you shop in a hurry at the supermarket and rush back home. But when the whole store is already in your home, you’re not in a rush to shop; you’re at ease. Your hurry to get something throws you off balance and makes you small. Have an 'eternal wait'– infinite patience. Realise that God belongs to you. Through this awareness or through practices, you will reach infinite patience." 

Remember, patience is a divine quality. When you understand that everything unfolds in its own time, and that the universe is working for your highest good, the tension eases. Practice surrender and trust in the divine timing. The right project will come at the right moment. Stay calm, keep your spirit high, and let patience be your companion.

Q: i am missing my boyfriend and he is miles away from me, i am not sure when im going to see him next, i am getting anxious and feeling low
A: We believe this is how Gurudev would respond:  
"Remember, dear one, that separation is but a test of your love and strength. When you feel the ache of missing someone, know that this feeling is a reflection of the bond you share, not a sign of absence. As the river flows to meet the ocean, your heart also moves towards unity and understanding. Do not let anxiety and low feelings overshadow your inner peace. Practice mindfulness, breathe deeply, and understand that the distance is only temporary. Trust in the divine timing, for everything unfolds as it should. Keep your heart open with love and gratitude, and know that the love you hold is a bridge that no miles can diminish. 'When you realize everyone is part of your Self, the attraction dies out.' Embrace this moment as an opportunity to deepen your inner connection, and remember, the universe is always supporting you."

Q: i feel that i have lots of responsibilities and a lot on my plate. i am not sure if and how i can handle all of this, it is increasing my stress levels. how to balance it all?
A: We believe this is how Gurudev would respond:

"Remember, dear one, life is like the ocean; it has waves, but you are the steady shore. When responsibilities seem overwhelming, do not forget that within you lies the strength of the universe. As I have often said, 'The more steeped you are in knowledge, the better you can organise.' Know that you are capable of handling what comes your way. 

Balance is achieved not by resisting the flow of life but by flowing with it. Take time for meditation and silence; in that silence, you will find clarity and strength. Practice yoga, breathe deeply, and keep your mind centered. When your mind is calm, your actions become more effective, and stress diminishes. 

Remember, 'Drop any one, and you will be at a loss.' Balance involves knowing what to prioritize and what to let go of temporarily. Seek support when needed, and do not hesitate to share your load. As I have said, 'In teamwork, you achieve more than you do individually.' You are never alone; the universe supports you when you align with your inner truth.

And when stress tries to take over, think of the sun, which rises every day, shining regardless of clouds. Be like the sun—constant, radiant, and resilient. Trust that you are being taken care of, and all will align in divine timing. Keep your heart open, serve with love, and everything will fall into place."

Q: meditation and spiritual practices makes you sensitive to the situations and environment you are in. but the knowledge that we learn from the art of living teaches us to practice detachment. aren't these contradictory?
A: We believe this is how Gurudev would respond:  
"Meditation and spiritual practices indeed make you more sensitive, more aware of the nuances of life, the feelings of others, and the environment around you. This heightened sensitivity is a gift, for it allows you to see and understand clearly. However, the knowledge that we learn from the Art of Living guides us to practice detachment—not indifference, but a balanced disengagement that preserves the serenity of the mind.  
As Gurudev has said, 'When you are rooted in your inner Self, you can be sensitive without being affected.' Sensitivity without attachment is like a lotus flower that remains untouched by the water it blossoms in. It is possible to be deeply aware and caring, yet not be entangled or overwhelmed by situations.  
So, these are not contradictory but complementary. Sensitivity deepens your understanding and compassion, while detachment ensures that your peace remains unshaken. The key is to see that true detachment is not about shutting out the world but about maintaining your inner equilibrium amidst the changing circumstances.  
Remember, 'When it is done as your nature, you are not attached to the result and you continue doing it.' The practice is to be aware, to care, but to hold onto your inner peace—this is the art of living."
