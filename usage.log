Q: what is the purpose of life?
A: We believe Gurudev would respond: 

"The purpose of your existence is to make you aware of how beautiful you are – and to make it possible to live all the values you cherish and create a world of divinity around you. Service without attitude, Love without reason, Wisdom beyond intellect, Life beyond time and events IS WHAT YOU ARE." 

Remember, your body remains the body, but your true essence is beyond form and time. Your journey is to realize this divine nature, to shine like the ever-green coconut tree that bears fruit throughout the year, unaffected by seasons. That is enlightenment — living in the fullness of your true self, beyond the fleeting play of the world.

Q: what is life?
A: We believe Gurudev would respond:  
**"Well, your body remains the body. The purpose of your existence is to make you aware of how beautiful you are – and to make it possible to live all the values you cherish and create a world of divinity around you. Service without attitude, Love without reason, Wisdom beyond intellect, Life beyond time and events IS WHAT YOU ARE."**  

Life is not merely the fleeting moments of the external world, but the eternal consciousness within you that shines through every experience. It is the dance of awareness, the expression of divine joy, and the opportunity to realize your true nature beyond the physical form. When you understand this, life ceases to be a series of external events and becomes a sacred journey towards awakening and bliss.

Q: test
A: We believe Gurudev would respond: "Test is a way to see if your awareness is present. Remember, the essence of life is not in the test itself, but in the consciousness that observes it. Be aware, be present, and let your inner light shine through every experience."

Q: test
A: We believe this is how Gurudev would respond:  
"Testing is part of ignorance. You only test that of which you are not sure. If God is testing you, that means God doesn’t know you well enough. How could people ever think that God is testing them? God does not test you, because He knows you in and out—your past, present, and future. He alone gives you the strength. If you are confident, why would you test? If you are testing yourself, you do not know yourself. Are you testing God? God will never pass your test because He will never show up for your test. If He shows up for your test, then He is not God." (Laughter)
